# Automating Server Provisioning with Vagrant and Terraform

Now that I've set up a front-end for my site, I wanted to ensure that I could re-provision the entire setup on a different server—whether cloud-based or on-premises—without manual intervention. This process is similar to configuring `User Data` for an EC2 instance, allowing the installation of necessary dependencies when the instance is provisioned or started.

To achieve this, I followed a two-step approach:

1. **Local Development and Testing**: I used Vagrant to provision a virtual machine on my local PC, allowing me to test the installation and configuration scripts in a controlled environment before deploying them to the cloud.
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Once the provisioning script was successfully tested locally, I transferred it to a Terraform repository, which automated the setup of an EC2 instance with the same configuration on AWS.

This structured approach ensured that my infrastructure setup was both repeatable and cost-effective.

## Development Process

Since an EC2 instance is essentially a cloud-based server, I didn't want to test my provisioning script directly on an EC2 instance, as that would require launching a new instance every time I made changes. Instead, I leveraged [`Vagrant`](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

For those unfamiliar with Vagrant, it is a tool that enables automatic provisioning of virtual machines using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It allows you to define a `Vagrantfile` (written in Ruby), where you can specify:

- The machine's base image
- Architectural specifications like CPU, RAM, etc.
- Installation steps for required dependencies during provisioning

This made Vagrant the perfect tool for testing my provisioning steps locally before deploying them on AWS, ultimately saving costs. You can check out my Vagrantfile [here](#).

## Cloud Setup Process

## test

I like to think of [`Terraform`](https://www.terraform.io/) as the cloud equivalent of Vagrant. While the syntax differs, the core logic remains the same. Terraform uses `HashiCorp Configuration Language` (HCL) to define infrastructure and allows you to automatically provision cloud resources.

Since Terraform is designed for cloud infrastructure rather than on-premises environments, you need to specify a cloud provider. In my case, I used `AWS`. With HCL, I provisioned an EC2 instance and executed the same installation script used in the [Development Process](#development-process) above to install dependencies such as `Nginx`, `Node.js`, and `PM2`. Once I had successfully set up the provisioning script locally using Vagrant, I was able to copy it over to a repository that used Terraform for cloud deployment. This made it easy to transition from local testing to cloud provisioning.

### Handling Private Repositories

One challenge I faced was ensuring that the two repositories my project depended on were automatically cloned during the provisioning process. Unfortunately, there was no straightforward solution. I had to:

1. Generate a private SSH key
2. Manually add it to the repository
3. Modify the provisioning steps to reference this private key

This allowed GitHub to authenticate and clone the repository as part of the provisioning process.

By using **Vagrant** for local testing and **Terraform** for cloud deployment, I streamlined my server provisioning workflow, making it both repeatable and cost-effective.
